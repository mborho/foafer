FOAFer
======

This is the source code running http://www.foafer.org

FOAFer displays (most) foaf resources in a somehow readable form.

The scripts are intended to run on the Google Appengine, therefore some things are not 
made in the best possible manner. For example, there is AFAIK no way to run SPARQL on the 
Appengine. So parsing the triples is made via a horrible unintuitive way of dict lookups.

Feel free to change this!
