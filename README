FOAFer
======

This is the source code running foafer.org

FOAFer displays most foaf resources in a somehow readable form.

The scripts are intended to run on the Google Appengne, therefore some things are not 
made in the best possible way. For example,the is AFAIK no way to run Sparql on the 
Appengine. So parsing the Triples is made via some sort of dict lookups.

Feel free to change it, this is released under the GNU Affero General Public License V3.
